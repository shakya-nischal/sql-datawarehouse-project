Data Segmentation Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To group data into meaningful categories for targeted insights.
    - For customer segmentation, product categorization, or regional analysis.

SQL Functions Used:
    - CASE: Defines custom segmentation logic.
    - GROUP BY: Groups data into segments.

-- 11. Data-Segmentation
-- Group the data based on a specific range.
-- Helps understand the correlation between two measures.
-- [Measure] BY [Measure]
-- Total Products By Sales Range
-- Total Customers By Age
--------------------------SQL Tasks---------------------------------------------------------
-- Segment products into cost ranges and count how many products fall into each segment
